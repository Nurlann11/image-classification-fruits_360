## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Fruits 360 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits). It consists of images of fruits divided into training and test sets.

- **Test Accuracy**
The final test accuracy achieved is approximately 98.6%.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
